<h3>Assisting people in locating their things and placing them where they belong in their everyday lives.</h3>
<p>
  As we mentioned in our About Us page, forget me not was founded by three forgetful Stanford graduates. Our mission is to help people keep track of their things and remember what they need to do. We also hope that after using our app and smartwatch for a while, people will be able to remember what they need to do each day better and more regularly. Here’s how it all started:
</p>
<p>Sophie, Ellie, and Zainab first met at a Stanford reunion party. They got to know each other a bit, and started meeting up with each other after the party. Soon, they had an idea for an app that can easily help you remember your things. First, they developed the app. It was very simple. You could set reminders for yourself, just like any other app. So, they decided to make it more unique. They knew that children tend to be much more forgetful than adults, so they decided to target families.
</p>
<p> Eventually, they came up with the idea to make a smartwatch for kids, and an app for adults (to learn more about how each of them work, go to our product page). But, before even selling their first prototypes of the watch, they soon realized that the app was a bit useless when they had a watch, so, as the final puzzle piece to complete their business. They decided to link together the watch and app. The parents supervised their kids using the app, and the kids used the watch to help remind themselves every day.
</p>
<p> To test their product they sent out free prototypes of both the app and watch to different parent groups. The product got really good feedback from all groups, and forget me not now hopes to grow it further. With more funding, forget me not could become a key component in everyone’s lives by making their day better by just doing the simple thing of reminding them. Please donate to help them achieve their mission!
