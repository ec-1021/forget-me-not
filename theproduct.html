            <h3>What makes forget me not special is that we have both an app and a watch. 
               The watch is designed for kids to help keep track of their things/know what they have to do. You get rewards for keeping track of your things.
               The app is designed for parents to set reminders for their kids and look at their children's progress.</h3></h1></center></td>

            <h3>The Watch:</h3>
            <p>Our watch is specially designed for kids:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is very comfortable, but is still made of recycled materials. </li>
                <li>We have many different color/pattern choices. </li>
                <li> The watch screen itself is very animated, so kids will be drawn to it </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>But, what is probably our most important component is what is actually in the watch itself...</h5>
            <p>Everyone knows that kids love videogames. If they could, they would just stare at a screen all day, leveling themselves up in Fortnite.
                Our team knew this, so we decided to integrate the idea of a reward system into our product. This makes it more appealing because it is like a game.</p>
            <h5>How our watch actually works: </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The default screen for our watch is just whatever you want it to be. You can choose a picture, or anything you want. Then, you press the Start button </li>
                <li>Next, there is a list of reminders that the child or their parents can set. Each reminder has a deadline for when it has to be done. Also, the watch pings when a reminder is 30 minutes until its deadline.</li>
                <li>The child can mark any reminder as done, and earn points. The earlier they do it, the more points they get. </li>
                <li>At the end of each week, the watch tallies up the child's points, and sends them to the parents. </li>

		<td>
			<h3>The App:</h3>
<p>With our app, parents can easily look at their kid's progress and set reminders for them digitally as well.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Every day, parents will recieve the total amount of points their child recieved that day. At the end of each week, the total number of points will be sent.</li>
    <li>The app also has the same home screen that you can choose as the app.</li>
    <li>From their app, parents can set reminders for each of their kids.</li>
    <li>Parents can also set reminders for themselves, but they do not have a reward system, only a Mark As Done button.</li>
</ul>
